# Weather

A compact, easy-to-extend weather application that fetches and displays current conditions and short-term forecasts from public weather APIs. Designed to be configurable, lightweight, and straightforward to integrate into CLI, web, or library workflows.

## Key points

-   Fetches current weather forecasts
-   Configurable location and units (metric/imperial)
-   Supports API key configuration and simple caching
-   Small surface area for tests and extensions

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies
2. Set your weather API key (e.g., WEATHER_API_KEY)
3. Run the app to view current conditions and forecast

## Contribution

Open issues and PRs welcome. Focus on tests, clear API configuration, and minimal dependencies.
